# Reactivities

A social network web-app, that combines a front-end on React and back-end on C#. I am developing the project using .NET 5 framework. It features user authentication, CRUD operations with UI and follower functionality. In this project I used MobX for state management, Formik for handling the forms, and React Dropzone for the file upload widget. I used Typescript instead of JavaScript for type safety and scalability. The project is based on clean architecture.
